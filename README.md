# AIxQuant

This is a light-weight project that develops simulation/real evironments and trading agents, along with collecting academic resources.

## Academic research list

see doc/paper_list.md, and the list is orginized into two groups:

  1, rule-based agents, which applies computational intelligence methods to discover rules, like genetic programing methods.

  2, machine learning agents, which applies modulized machine learning to predict price trend or end-to-end methods to trade.

## Simulation/Real environments

see src/env

## Agents
